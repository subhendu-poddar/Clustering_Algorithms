# Implementation of Clustering Algorithms and Comparing their Performances

We have implemented three partitioned clustering algorithms, namely K-means, K-medians and K-medoids clustering algorithms and a hierarchical clustering algorithm, namely Bisecting K-means clustering algorithm. Then we implemented four very popular validity indices â€“ Dunn index, Davies-Bouldin(DB) index, Silhouette index(SI), and CDbw index. Then we analyse the results obtained using 15 different real-life datasets.
